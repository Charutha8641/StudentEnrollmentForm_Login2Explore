# STUDENT ENROLLMENT FORM
## Description

I have created a basic Student enrollment Form using HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap. 

* The form consists of 3 buttons - Save, Update and Reset. And, 6 input fields.
* While entering the details, only the Save and Rest buttons are active while the update button is disabled.
* On entering the deatils, all the informations gets stored in the JasonPowerDB.
* When the same Roll No is entered the informations pertaining to that particular student is displayed. 
* Changes, if any, could be made and the Update button is enabled.
